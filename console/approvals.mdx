## Overview

The **Approvals Page** is your inbox for reviewing and approving sensitive agent actions. Agents request approval when attempting high-risk operations, and humans make the final decision.

## Layout

The page has two main tabs:

1. **Pending Actions** - Approval requests awaiting decision
2. **Decision History** - All past approvals with outcomes

## Dashboard stats

At the top, 6 metrics show approval workflow health:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Pending** | Approvals awaiting decision |
| **Critical/High Priority** | Urgent approvals needing immediate attention |
| **Average Decision Time** | Mean time from request to decision |
| **Info Requested** | Approvals where you asked for more context |
| **Total Decisions** | Lifetime approval decisions |
| **Approval Rate** | % of requests approved vs rejected |

## Pending actions tab

## Real-time behavior

### Live updates

When a new approval is created:
1. Appears at top of list with slide-in animation
2. Browser notification (if enabled): "New approval required"
3. Sound alert for critical priority (optional)

When an approval is decided elsewhere:
1. Card updates in real-time
2. Moves from "Pending" to "Decision History"
3. Stats refresh

When approaching expiration:
1. Countdown changes color
2. Critical priority items flash (< 1 min remaining)

### Expiration handling

When an approval expires:
1. Status changes to "EXPIRED"
2. Card grays out
3. Moves to "Decision History" tab
4. Agent receives `TimeoutError`
5. Intervention created with type "APPROVAL_REQUIRED", outcome "BLOCKED"

## Common workflows

### Daily approval triage

1. Navigate to **Approvals** page
2. Sort by "Expiring soonest"
3. Review all critical/high priority first
4. For each:
   - Read description and context
   - Check risk level
   - Verify agent intent
   - Approve or reject with notes
5. Check "Info Requested" for agent responses

### Handle critical approvals

1. Filter by priority="Critical"
2. Open review modal
3. Read full context and inputs
4. Verify this is legitimate and necessary
5. If unclear, click "Request Info"
6. Once satisfied, approve with detailed notes
7. Monitor in Decision History to ensure action succeeds

### Review approval patterns

1. Go to "Decision History" tab
2. Filter by time range (e.g., last 30 days)
3. Identify patterns:
   - Which actions are frequently requested?
   - Which agent requests most approvals?
   - What's your approval rate?
4. If approval rate is low (< 70%), investigate:
   - Are agents attempting inappropriate actions?
   - Should policies be adjusted?

### Respond to info requests

1. Filter by status="Info Requested"
2. See agent's response to your question
3. Review additional context provided
4. Return to approval review
5. Make decision now that you have more info

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `a` - Approve (when modal open)
- `r` - Reject (when modal open)
- `i` - Request info (when modal open)
- `Esc` - Close modal
- `/` - Focus search/filter

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Respond quickly**: Approvals have timeouts - aim to decide within 50% of timeout window to avoid expiration.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Add detailed notes**: Notes are logged for compliance - explain your reasoning for approvals and rejections.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Never quick-approve high-risk actions**: Always use the full review modal for high/critical risk approvals.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Use info requests liberally**: If anything is unclear, request more info rather than guessing.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Monitor approval rates**: If you're rejecting > 30% of requests, review agent logic or policy configuration.
</Tip>

## Notifications

Configure approval notifications in **Settings** → **Notifications**:

- **Email**: Get email for critical/high priority approvals
- **Slack**: Approval requests posted to #approvals channel
- **Webhook**: POST to custom URL for integration with your tools
- **Browser**: Push notifications (requires permission)

## Troubleshooting

### "Approval disappeared"

- Check "Decision History" tab - may have been decided
- Check for expired approvals
- Verify not filtered out by current filters

### "Can't approve - button disabled"

- Check if approval already expired
- Verify you have permission (correct organization)
- Refresh page - may be stale data

### "Agent says approval pending, but I don't see it"

- Check organization selector - may be in wrong org
- Verify agent's `agent_id` matches your filters
- Check "Info Requested" status
- Look in "Decision History" - may have auto-expired

### "Countdown not updating"

- Check WebSocket connection (should show "REALTIME")
- Refresh page to reset connection
- Browser tab may be inactive - revisit tab
