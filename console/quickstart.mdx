## Sign up and login

1. Navigate to [console.agentsentinel.dev](https://console.agentsentinel.dev)
2. Click "Sign Up" or "Sign In" (powered by Clerk)
3. Create an account using:
   - Email + password
   - Google OAuth
   - GitHub OAuth

## Quick Start wizard

On first login, you'll see the **Quick Start Wizard** - a 4-step guide to get you up and running.

### Step 1: Welcome

Introduction to Agent Sentinel features:
- **Interventions**: See what actions Sentinel blocks
- **Approvals**: Human oversight for sensitive operations
- **Runs & Replay**: Debug agents with zero-cost replay
- **Activity Ledger**: Complete audit trail
- **Analytics**: Cost and performance tracking

Click "Next" to continue.

### Step 2: Create API Key

Generate your first API key for SDK integration:

1. Click "Generate API Key" button
2. Copy the key immediately (shown only once)
3. Store it securely (password manager, secrets vault)
4. Click "Next"

<Warning>
**API keys are shown only once.** If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one in Settings → API Keys.
</Warning>

### Step 3: SDK Setup

Choose your language and copy the code snippet:

**Python:**
```python
from agent_sentinel import enable_remote_sync, guarded_action

# Enable platform sync
enable_remote_sync(
    platform_url="https://platform.agentsentinel.dev",
    api_token="as_your_api_key_here",  # Replace with your key
    run_id="run-001",
)

# Instrument your functions
@guarded_action(name="search_web", cost_usd=0.01, tags=["tool"])
def search_web(query: str) -> dict:
    return {"results": ["..."]}
```

**JavaScript (coming soon):**
```javascript
import { enableRemoteSync, guardedAction } from 'agent-sentinel';

// Enable platform sync
enableRemoteSync({
  platformUrl: 'https://platform.agentsentinel.dev',
  apiToken: 'as_your_api_key_here',
  agentId: 'my-agent',
  runId: 'run-001',
});

// Instrument your functions
const searchWeb = guardedAction('search_web', { costUsd: 0.01 }, (query) => {
  return { results: ['...'] };
});
```

Click "Copy Code" and paste into your agent code.

### Step 4: Complete

Wizard completion with next steps:

1. ✅ API key created
2. ✅ SDK setup instructions provided
3. 🎯 **Next**: Run your agent and view telemetry in the console
4. 📚 **Learn more**: Check out the full documentation

Click "Get Started" to go to the main dashboard.

## Verify integration

After running your agent with the SDK:

1. Navigate to **Runs** page
2. See your first run appear within seconds
3. Click the run to see action details
4. View costs, duration, and outcome

<Tip>
If you don't see your run within 30 seconds, check:
- API key is correct
- `platform_url` matches your deployment
- Network connectivity to platform
- SDK version is up-to-date
</Tip>

## Explore the console

### 1. Dashboard

Main overview with:
- 5 stat cards (Total Runs, Units, Consumption, Pending Approvals, Failure Rate)
- 8 tabbed sections
- Real-time connection indicator
- Notifications bell

**Try it**: Click on stat cards to filter related views.

### 2. Interventions

Policy enforcement monitoring:
- Total interventions
- Blocked actions
- Cost saved
- High-risk blocks

**Try it**: Set up a policy with denied actions, then attempt one - see it blocked in real-time.

### 3. Approvals

Human-in-the-loop workflow:
- Pending approvals with countdown
- Priority and risk indicators
- One-click approve/reject

**Try it**: Mark an action as `requires_human_approval=True` and watch it appear in the inbox.

### 4. Runs

Execution history:
- Run registry with filtering
- Telemetry view (action sequences)
- Replay simulation
- Determinism analysis

**Try it**: Click "Simulate Replay" on a completed run to test determinism.

### 5. Activity Ledger

Complete audit trail:
- All actions across all runs
- Advanced filtering
- Export capabilities
- Compliance metadata

**Try it**: Use the search bar to find specific actions by name or input content.

### 6. Agents

Agent discovery:
- Auto-registered agents
- Performance metrics
- Activity timelines
- Recent runs

**Try it**: Click an agent to see detailed statistics and edit display name.

### 7. Analytics

Cost and performance:
- 30-day consumption chart
- Daily breakdown
- Average metrics
- Time-based filtering

**Try it**: Switch between 24h, 7d, 30d views to see cost trends.

### 8. Settings

Configuration:
- **Policies**: Create budget limits, denied actions, rate limits
- **API Keys**: Generate, view, revoke tokens
- **Notifications**: Configure Slack, Email, Webhooks (coming soon)

**Try it**: Create a policy with a $1 run budget, then watch it enforce in real-time.

## Common tasks

### Create a budget policy

1. Go to **Settings** → **Policies** tab
2. Click "Create Policy"
3. Set name: "Development Budget"
4. Set run budget: $1.00
5. Set session budget: $5.00
6. Enable the policy
7. Save

### Generate additional API keys

1. Go to **Settings** → **API Keys** tab
2. Click "Generate New Key"
3. Copy the key immediately
4. Key appears in list with prefix (e.g., `as_a1b2c3...`)

### Approve a pending action

1. Go to **Approvals** page
2. Click "Review" on a pending approval
3. Review action details, inputs, risk level
4. Click "Approve" or "Reject"
5. Add optional notes
6. Confirm

### Export activity ledger

1. Go to **Activity Ledger** page
2. Apply any desired filters
3. Click "Export" button
4. Choose format (JSONL, JSON, CSV)
5. File downloads immediately

### View agent statistics

1. Go to **Agents** page
2. Click on an agent
3. See comprehensive stats:
   - Total runs, actions, cost
   - Success rate
   - Recent activity (24h, 7d, 30d)
   - Approval metrics
   - Intervention rate

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `/` - Focus search bar (where available)
- `Esc` - Close modals and dialogs
- `Cmd/Ctrl + K` - Command palette (coming soon)

## Troubleshooting

### "No runs showing"

- Verify API key is correct
- Check SDK is configured with `enable_remote_sync()`
- Confirm agent is actually running
- Check browser console for errors

### "Real-time updates not working"

- Check WebSocket connection indicator (top right)
- Verify no firewall blocking WebSocket (port 443)
- Try refreshing the page
- Fallback polling should activate automatically

### "API key not working"

- Ensure key starts with `as_`
- Copy full key including prefix
- Check key is active (Settings → API Keys)
- Verify organization matches

### "Approval not appearing"

- Confirm `requires_human_approval=True` on action
- Check action hasn't already completed
- Verify timeout hasn't expired
- Look in "Decision History" tab for expired approvals
