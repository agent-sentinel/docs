## Overview

The **Quick Start Wizard** is an interactive onboarding experience that guides new users through setting up their first Agent Sentinel integration. It appears automatically for first-time users and can be accessed anytime from the dashboard.

## When it appears

The wizard shows:
- **First login** - Automatically on first console access
- **Empty dashboard** - When no agents are connected
- **Manual trigger** - Click "Quick Start" button in settings

## Wizard steps

### Step 1: Welcome

**What you see:**
- Welcome message and overview
- Three key benefits:
  - 🔑 **Auth** - Secure API keys for your agents
  - 💻 **SDK** - Simple drop-in code snippets
  - 🛡️ **Guard** - Real-time policy enforcement
- "Get Started" button to proceed

**Purpose:** Orient new users to what Agent Sentinel provides.

### Step 2: Create API Key

**What you see:**
- Input field for key description
- "Generate & Continue" button
- Note about managing keys later

**What happens:**
- Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "My Awesome Agent")
- Click Generate
- System creates API key with full permissions
- Key is displayed (only time you'll see the full key!)

**Example:**
```
Key Description: "Production Trading Bot"
Generated Key: as_1234567890abcdef...
```

**Important:** Save this key somewhere safe - you won't see it again!

### Step 3: SDK Setup

**What you see:**
- Your newly generated API key (highlighted)
- Code snippets for Python and JavaScript
- Copy buttons for each snippet
- Warning banner to save the key

**Python snippet:**
```python
from agent_sentinel import Sentinel

# Initialize the sentinel
sentinel = Sentinel(
    api_key="as_1234567890abcdef...",
    base_url="https://console.example.com/api/proxy"
)

# Protect your agent's execution
with sentinel.monitor(run_id="my-first-run"):
    # Your agent logic here
    result = agent.run("Hello world")
    sentinel.log_action("llm_call", inputs={"prompt": "Hello world"}, outputs=result)
```

**JavaScript snippet:**
```javascript
import { Sentinel } from '@agent-sentinel/sdk';

// Initialize the sentinel
const sentinel = new Sentinel({
  apiKey: 'as_1234567890abcdef...',
  baseUrl: 'https://console.example.com/api/proxy'
});

// Protect your agent's execution
await sentinel.monitor('my-first-run', async () => {
  // Your agent logic here
  const result = await agent.run('Hello world');
  await sentinel.logAction('llm_call', {
    inputs: { prompt: 'Hello world' },
    outputs: result
  });
});
```

**Features:**
- **One-click copy** - Copy entire snippet
- **Pre-filled API key** - Your actual key is included
- **Auto-configured URL** - Base URL points to current console
- **Language toggle** - Switch between Python and JavaScript

### Step 4: Complete

**What you see:**
- Success checkmark and celebration
- "You're All Set!" message
- Instructions to start agent
- "Enter Console" button

**What happens:**
- Click "Enter Console" to start using Agent Sentinel
- Dashboard will show data once agent starts sending telemetry

## Skipping the wizard

You can skip at any time:
- **Step 1**: Click "Skip for now" 
- **Other steps**: Click browser back or close

Skipped wizards can be restarted from Settings → Quick Start.

## After completing

Once complete:
1. **Paste code** into your agent
2. **Start agent** - Run it normally
3. **View dashboard** - Data appears within seconds
4. **Explore features**:
   - View runs in Runs page
   - Check ledger in Activity Ledger
   - Set budgets in Settings

## Design features

The wizard includes:

### Progress indicator
- Progress bar at top shows % complete
- Steps: 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%

### Navigation
- "Back" button to return to previous step
- "Continue" or "Next" buttons to proceed
- "Skip" option on first step

### Code copying
Copy buttons show feedback:
- Default: "Copy Python" / "Copy JS"
- After click: "✓ Copied" (2 second confirmation)

### Visual polish
- Step-by-step progression
- Clear CTAs (call-to-action buttons)
- Visual icons for each benefit
- Professional dark code blocks
- Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

## Restarting the wizard

To restart later:
1. Go to **Settings** page
2. Scroll to "Quick Start"
3. Click "Launch Wizard"

Or:
- Add `?wizard=true` to dashboard URL
- Click "Quick Start" in help menu

## Customization (self-hosted)

Self-hosted users can customize:

**Environment variables:**
```bash
# Disable wizard entirely
DISABLE_QUICK_START=true

# Change default code examples
QUICK_START_PYTHON_TEMPLATE=/path/to/template.py
QUICK_START_JS_TEMPLATE=/path/to/template.js

# Auto-skip for specific domains
SKIP_WIZARD_DOMAINS=internal.company.com
```

**Code templates:**
Templates support variables:
- `{{api_key}}` - User's generated key
- `{{base_url}}` - Console base URL
- `{{user_id}}` - User's ID
- `{{org_id}}` - Organization ID

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Save the API key**: Write it down or save to password manager immediately - you can't retrieve it later!
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Test immediately**: After completing wizard, run your agent to verify integration works.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use descriptive names**: Name API keys descriptively (e.g., "Production Bot", "Dev Testing") for easier management.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Don't commit keys**: Never commit API keys to version control. Use environment variables instead.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**One key per environment**: Create separate keys for development, staging, and production.
</Tip>

## Common issues

### "Generate button doesn't work"

- Ensure key description is filled in
- Try refreshing the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Contact support if persists

### "Code doesn't work"

Make sure to:
- Install the SDK (`pip install agent-sentinel`)
- Use the exact API key from wizard
- Check base URL matches your console
- Verify network connectivity

### "Lost my API key"

If you didn't save the key:
1. Go to Settings → API Keys
2. Delete the old key
3. Create a new key
4. Update your agent code

### "Want to skip a step"

You can navigate back or close the wizard at any time. Access it again from Settings.

## Security considerations

### API key security
- Keys are shown **only once** during wizard
- Keys are hashed before storage
- Full key is never retrievable after creation
- Delete compromised keys immediately

### Best practices
- Use separate keys per agent
- Rotate keys regularly
- Store in secret management system
- Monitor key usage in Settings → API Keys

## For teams

### Team onboarding
1. **Admin** completes wizard first
2. **Admin** shares code template (without API key)
3. **Team members** create their own keys
4. **Everyone** uses same base URL

### Multiple agents
- Run wizard once for first agent
- Create additional keys in Settings → API Keys
- Each agent can use same or different keys

## Analytics

The wizard tracks:
- Completion rate
- Drop-off points
- Time to completion
- Most copied snippets

This data helps improve the onboarding experience.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `Enter` - Continue to next step
- `Esc` - Close/skip wizard
- `Cmd/Ctrl + C` - Copy code snippet (when focused)
