## Overview

The **Analytics Page** provides visual insights into agent costs and performance. Track spending trends, identify expensive operations, and optimize your agent fleet.

## Time window selector

At the top, choose time range:
- **Last 24 hours**
- **Last 7 days**
- **Last 30 days**
- **All time**

All charts and stats update based on selected window.

## Cost dashboard

### 30-day consumption chart

**Bar chart** showing daily costs:

- **X-axis**: Dates (last 30 days)
- **Y-axis**: Cost (USD)
- **Bars**: Daily spending
- **Hover**: See exact cost for each day

**Visual features:**
- **Color coding**:
  - 🟢 Green - Below average
  - 🟡 Yellow - Average
  - 🔴 Red - Above average
- **Trend line**: Overlaid to show direction
- **Annotations**: Mark significant events (deployments, incidents)

**Insights:**
- Spot cost spikes
- Identify trends (increasing/decreasing)
- Correlate with deployments or changes
- Weekly patterns (weekdays vs weekends)

### Total consumption

Large stat card showing:
- **Total Cost** - Sum for selected time window
- **Comparison** - vs previous period
  - ⬆️ 15% increase
  - ⬇️ 10% decrease
  - ➡️ No change (< 2%)
- **Projection** - Estimated monthly cost (if trend continues)

**Example:**
```
Total Consumption (Last 30 days)
$567.89
⬆️ 15% vs previous 30 days
Projected monthly: ~$580
```

### Daily breakdown table

Table showing each day with:
- **Date**
- **Runs** - Count of runs
- **Actions** - Count of actions
- **Cost** - Total USD
- **Avg Cost per Run** - Mean cost
- **Avg Cost per Action** - Mean cost

**Sorting:**
- Click any column header to sort
- Default: Date (descending)

**Export:**
- Download as CSV for analysis in Excel/BI tools

## Performance dashboard

### Average metrics

Three stat cards:

**1. Avg Cost per Action**
```
$0.0123
⬇️ 5% vs previous period
```
Lower is better - shows efficiency improving.

**2. Avg Duration per Action**
```
523ms
➡️ No change vs previous period
```
Lower is better - shows performance.

**3. Actions per Run**
```
37.2
⬆️ 8% vs previous period
```
Context-dependent - more actions = more work done OR inefficiency.

### Cost by action type

**Pie chart** showing distribution:
- Each slice = one action type
- Size = proportion of total cost
- Hover for exact amount
- Click to filter ledger by that action

**Example breakdown:**
- 🔵 call_llm: $234.56 (41%)
- 🟢 search_web: $123.45 (22%)
- 🟡 fetch_data: $89.12 (16%)
- 🟠 analyze_text: $67.89 (12%)
- Others: $52.87 (9%)

**Insights:**
- Identify top cost drivers
- Focus optimization on largest slices
- Track changes over time

### Cost by agent

**Bar chart** (horizontal) showing:
- Agent names (Y-axis)
- Cost (X-axis)
- Sorted by cost (descending)
- Color-coded by relative cost

**Use cases:**
- Identify most expensive agents
- Compare agent efficiency
- Budget allocation by agent

### Actions over time

**Line chart** showing:
- **X-axis**: Time (hours, days, or months based on window)
- **Y-axis**: Action count
- **Multiple lines**: Different action types

**Insights:**
- Usage patterns (peak times)
- Growth trends
- Action mix changes

## Cost optimization recommendations

**AI-powered suggestions** based on your data:

### High-cost actions

```
💡 Recommendation: Optimize LLM calls

Finding: "call_llm" accounts for 45% of costs ($234.56)

Suggestions:
• Reduce max_tokens from 1000 to 500 (potential savings: ~$100/month)
• Use gpt-4o-mini for simple queries (potential savings: ~$80/month)
• Implement response caching (potential savings: ~$50/month)

Total potential savings: $230/month (40%)
```

### Inefficient patterns

```
⚠️ Warning: Redundant API calls detected

Finding: Agent "trading-bot" calls "fetch_price" avg 15 times per run

Suggestion: Cache price data for 5 minutes to reduce API calls

Potential savings: $45/month
```

### Rate limiting opportunities

```
💡 Recommendation: Add rate limiting

Finding: "search_web" called 500+ times/day

Suggestion: Rate limit to 100 calls/hour to prevent runaway costs

Risk reduction: Prevents potential $1000+ cost incidents
```

## Filters and segmentation

### Filter by agent

Select specific agents to analyze:
- Compare costs across agents
- Focus on one agent's performance
- Identify underutilized agents

### Filter by action type

Select specific action types:
- Analyze LLM costs separately
- Track API call costs
- Compare tool usage

### Group by

Change aggregation:
- **By day** - Daily breakdown
- **By hour** - Hourly breakdown (for 24h window)
- **By week** - Weekly breakdown (for 30d+ window)
- **By month** - Monthly breakdown (for all time)

## Cost alerts (future)

**Coming soon**: Automated cost alerts:

- **Budget thresholds** - Alert when approaching budget
- **Anomalies** - Detect unusual cost spikes
- **Projections** - Warn if projected monthly cost exceeds budget
- **Delivery** - Email, Slack, webhooks

## Common workflows

### Monthly cost review

1. Select "Last 30 days" time window
2. Review total consumption
3. Check 30-day chart for spikes
4. Investigate anomalies:
   - Click spike day in chart
   - Filter Activity Ledger by that date
   - Review expensive actions
5. Check cost by action type pie chart
6. Read optimization recommendations
7. Implement suggested optimizations

### Agent cost comparison

1. View "Cost by Agent" chart
2. Identify top 3 most expensive agents
3. For each agent:
   - Click bar to navigate to agent details
   - Review "Top Actions"
   - Check "Cost Breakdown"
   - Look for optimization opportunities
4. Compare with similar agents:
   - Why is Agent A 3x more expensive than Agent B?
   - Different usage patterns?
   - Different action mix?
   - Bugs or inefficiencies?

### Track optimization impact

1. Note current "Avg Cost per Action" before optimization
2. Implement optimization (e.g., use cheaper model)
3. Wait 24 hours
4. Return to Analytics page
5. Compare "Avg Cost per Action"
6. Calculate savings:
   ```
   Daily savings = (Old avg - New avg) × Daily actions
   Monthly projection = Daily savings × 30
   ```
7. Document successful optimizations

### Budget planning

1. Select "Last 30 days"
2. Note "Total Consumption"
3. Check "Projected monthly" estimate
4. Review "Cost by Agent" to allocate budgets
5. Set per-agent budgets in Settings → Policies
6. Monitor adherence in future periods

### Identify usage patterns

1. View "Actions over time" chart
2. Look for patterns:
   - Peak usage times (optimize for these)
   - Weekend vs weekday differences
   - Growth trends (plan capacity)
   - Seasonal variations
3. Adjust:
   - Scale infrastructure for peaks
   - Budget for expected growth
   - Implement rate limiting during peaks

## Export and reporting

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Review analytics weekly**: Set a recurring calendar reminder to review analytics every Monday.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Act on recommendations**: The AI suggestions are based on real data - implementing them can save 20-40% on costs.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Spikes need investigation**: Any day with > 2x average cost should be investigated immediately to prevent runaway costs.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Compare periods**: Always use the period comparison (vs previous 30 days) to understand if you're improving or regressing.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Focus on top 20%**: Usually 20% of actions account for 80% of costs - optimize these first.

## Troubleshooting

### "Charts not loading"

- Check time window selector
- Verify you have runs in selected period
- Refresh page
- Try shorter time window

### "No data for selected period"

- Extend time window (try "All time")
- Check if any runs exist (Runs page)
- Verify agent is sending data

### "Cost seems wrong"

- Check if multiple agents are included
- Verify time window is correct
- Review Activity Ledger for source data
- Check for currency/timezone mismatches

### "Recommendations not showing"

- Recommendations appear after 7+ days of data
- Need minimum 100 actions for analysis
- Some patterns need 30 days to detect
