## Overview

The **Runs Page** provides complete visibility into agent execution history. View run details, analyze action sequences, simulate replays at zero cost, and detect non-deterministic behavior.

## Run registry

The main view shows all runs with filters:

### Filters

**By status:**
- **Running** - Currently executing (live updates)
- **Completed** - Finished successfully
- **Failed** - Encountered errors

**By cost:**
- **Min cost** - Show runs above cost threshold
- Useful for finding expensive runs

**By time window:**
- **24 hours** - Recent runs
- **7 days** - Last week
- **30 days** - Last month
- **All time** - Complete history

**By agent:**
- Filter by agent_id
- Type to search and select

### Run cards

Each run displays:

- **Run ID** - Unique identifier
- **Agent** - Agent name (link to agent page)
- **Status Badge** - Running (blue), Completed (green), Failed (red)
- **Duration** - Execution time
- **Actions** - Count of actions in run
- **Cost** - Total USD spent
- **Success Rate** - % of successful actions
- **Started** - Timestamp
- **Ended** - Timestamp (if completed)

**Visual indicators:**
- 🔵 **Running** - Animated pulse on status badge
- 🟢 **Completed** - Static green badge
- 🔴 **Failed** - Red badge with error icon

### Critical intercepts section

At the top, see **failed runs** that need attention:

- Runs with errors
- Runs exceeding budgets
- Runs with high intervention rates
- Sorted by recency

Click to view details and debug.

## Run details view

Click any run to open the details view with 3 tabs:

### Telemetry tab

Shows complete action sequence:

**Action list:**
- Sequential order of execution
- Action name
- Inputs (expandable JSON)
- Outputs (expandable JSON)
- Cost (USD)
- Duration (ms)
- Outcome (success/error/blocked/replayed)
- Timestamp

**Features:**
- **Search actions** - Find by name or content
- **Filter by outcome** - Show only errors, successes, blocked
- **Expand all** - View all inputs/outputs at once
- **Copy JSON** - Copy any input/output to clipboard

**Operation inspector sidebar:**

Click any action to open inspector showing:
- Full JSON inputs with syntax highlighting
- Full JSON outputs with syntax highlighting
- Metadata (UUID, timestamp, tags)
- Error details (if failed)
- Compliance metadata (if applicable)

**Example action:**
```json
{
  "action": "call_llm",
  "inputs": {
    "prompt": "What is 2+2?",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "max_tokens": 100
  },
  "outputs": {
    "response": "2 + 2 equals 4.",
    "tokens": 15,
    "cost_usd": 0.0008
  },
  "duration_ns": 523000000,
  "outcome": "success"
}
```

**Link to Activity Ledger:**
Click "View in Activity Ledger" to see all actions in filterable table.

### Simulation tab

**Zero-cost replay** - Re-execute the run using recorded outputs without calling external APIs.

**How it works:**
1. Click "Simulate Replay"
2. Platform replays run action-by-action
3. Uses cached outputs from original run
4. Detects divergences (different inputs/outputs)
5. Calculates potential cost savings

**Replay results:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Original cost** | What the run cost originally |
| **Replay cost** | Cost to replay (usually $0) |
| **Savings** | USD saved by using replay |
| **Divergences** | Count of mismatches |
| **Match rate** | % of actions that matched |

**Divergence details:**

When replay diverges from original:

- **Action name mismatch** - Different action was called
- **Input mismatch** - Same action, different inputs
- **Output mismatch** - Same inputs, different outputs (non-deterministic!)

**Comparison table:**

| Action | Original | Replay | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| call_llm | input: "Hello" | input: "Hello" | ✅ Match |
| call_llm | output: "Hi there!" | output: "Hi there!" | ✅ Match |
| generate_id | output: "uuid-123" | output: "uuid-456" | ❌ Diverged |

**Use cases:**
- **Debugging** - Replay failed runs to understand what happened
- **Testing** - Replay with different logic to test fixes
- **Cost savings** - Use replay for development/testing without API costs
- **Compliance** - Demonstrate reproducibility

### Determinism tab

**Automated analysis** of non-deterministic behavior.

**Determinism score:**

- **0-100 scale** (higher is better)
- Color-coded progress bar:
  - 🟢 **90-100** - Highly deterministic
  - 🟡 **70-89** - Moderately deterministic
  - 🟠 **50-69** - Low determinism
  - 🔴 **0-49** - Highly non-deterministic

**What's analyzed:**

Platform scans for common non-deterministic patterns:
- **Timestamps** - Current time in outputs
- **Random values** - Random numbers, UUIDs
- **External state** - Database queries, API calls without idempotency
- **Floating point** - Precision differences
- **Ordering** - Unordered collections (sets, dicts in Python < 3.7)

**Issues found:**

List of detected issues with:
- **Action name** - Where issue occurred
- **Issue type** - What kind of non-determinism
- **Severity** - Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Description** - What was detected
- **Line number** - If applicable

**Example:**
```
Issue: Timestamp in output
Action: generate_report
Severity: High
Description: Output contains current timestamp ("2024-12-28T14:30:00Z")
  which will differ on replay.
Recommendation: Pass timestamp as input parameter instead.
```

**Recommendations:**

Platform provides actionable advice:
- How to fix each issue
- Code snippets showing before/after
- Links to documentation
- Best practices for determinism

**Benefits of high determinism:**
- Easier debugging (reproducible errors)
- Lower testing costs (replay instead of re-execute)
- Compliance (demonstrate reproducibility)
- Reliability (predictable behavior)

## Real-time updates

**Live run monitoring:**

When viewing a **running** run:
- Action list updates in real-time as actions complete
- Stats refresh (cost, duration, action count)
- Progress indicator shows completion %
- Notifications when run completes or fails

**WebSocket events:**
- `run_created` - New run appears in list
- `action_created` - New action appears in telemetry
- `run_completed` - Status changes to completed
- `run_failed` - Status changes to failed

## Common workflows

### Debug a failed run

1. Go to **Critical Intercepts** section
2. Click failed run
3. Open **Telemetry** tab
4. Find first failed action (red badge)
5. Open operation inspector
6. Review error details and inputs
7. Identify root cause
8. Fix agent logic
9. Use **Simulation** tab to test fix with replay

### Analyze high-cost runs

1. Filter by min cost > $10
2. Sort by cost (descending)
3. For each expensive run:
   - Open telemetry
   - Find most expensive actions
   - Identify optimization opportunities
4. Implement caching, cheaper models, or rate limiting
5. Compare costs before/after

### Test determinism

1. Select a completed run
2. Go to **Simulation** tab
3. Click "Simulate Replay"
4. Review divergences
5. Go to **Determinism** tab
6. Read recommendations
7. Fix non-deterministic code
8. Re-run and verify score improves

### Review agent behavior

1. Filter by agent_id
2. Sort by recency
3. Review recent runs for patterns:
   - Success rates trending down?
   - Costs increasing?
   - New error types appearing?
4. Investigate anomalies
5. Adjust agent logic or policies

## Export runs

Click **Export** to download run data:

1. Respects current filters
2. Choose format: CSV, JSON, JSONL
3. Includes runs and all actions
4. Use for analysis, reporting, compliance

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Monitor failed runs daily**: Check Critical Intercepts section daily to catch issues early.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use replay for debugging**: Replay is free and gives identical behavior - perfect for debugging without re-running expensive LLM calls.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Non-determinism hurts debugging**: Runs with determinism scores < 70 are hard to debug. Prioritize fixing non-deterministic code.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Archive old runs**: Runs older than 90 days may be archived - export important runs for long-term storage.
</Tip>

## Keyboard shortcuts

- `r` - Simulate replay (when viewing run)
- `t` - Switch to Telemetry tab
- `s` - Switch to Simulation tab
- `d` - Switch to Determinism tab
- `/` - Focus search

## Troubleshooting

### "Replay not available"

- Replay requires original run to be complete
- Outputs must be stored (check retention policy)
- Some actions may not support replay (side effects)

### "Can't find my run"

- Check time window filter (may be outside range)
- Verify agent_id is correct
- Check if run was in different organization
- Try "All time" filter

### "Determinism score seems wrong"

- Score is based on automated analysis - may miss issues
- Use Simulation tab to manually check divergences
- Some non-determinism is acceptable (e.g., timestamps in logs)

### "Action inputs/outputs not showing"

- May be too large (> 1MB) - check raw data
- May contain binary data - not displayable
- Check if PII redaction is enabled
