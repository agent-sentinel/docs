## Overview

The **Interventions Page** provides real-time visibility into Agent Sentinel's policy enforcement. See exactly what actions were blocked, modified, or escalated - demonstrating the platform's core value.

## Dashboard stats

At the top of the page, 6 key metrics show intervention impact:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Total Interventions** | Count of all interventions |
| **Blocked Actions** | Actions prevented from executing |
| **Cost Saved** | USD prevented (estimated costs of blocked actions) |
| **Escalations** | Actions sent for human approval |
| **High Risk** | Count of critical/high-risk blocks |
| **Modified** | Actions with parameters changed |

**Example:**
```
Total Interventions: 1,456
Blocked Actions: 1,012
Cost Saved: $12,456.78
Escalations: 234
High Risk: 123
Modified: 45
```

## Filtering interventions

Use the filter bar to find specific interventions:

### Filter by type
- **Hard Block** - Action completely denied
- **Approval Required** - Escalated for human review
- **Rate Limited** - Blocked due to rate limits
- **Budget Exceeded** - Blocked due to budget constraints
- **Downgrade** - Parameters modified
- **Warning** - Flagged but allowed

### Filter by outcome
- **Blocked** - Not executed
- **Escalated** - Sent for review
- **Approved After Review** - Human approved
- **Rejected After Review** - Human rejected
- **Modified** - Parameters changed
- **Warned** - Logged with warning

### Filter by risk level
- **Critical** - Catastrophic impact
- **High** - Severe impact
- **Medium** - Moderate impact
- **Low** - Minor impact
- **Minimal** - Negligible impact

### Search
Use the search bar to find by:
- Action name
- Agent ID
- Policy name
- Description text

### Quick filters

Pre-configured filter chips:
- **Critical Risk** - Show only critical-risk interventions
- **High Cost Prevented** - Interventions that saved $100+
- **Last 24 Hours** - Recent interventions
- **Blocked by Policy X** - Filter by specific policy

## Intervention table

The main table shows all interventions with columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Timestamp** | When intervention occurred |
| **Type** | Intervention type badge |
| **Action** | Action name that was blocked/modified |
| **Agent** | Agent ID that attempted the action |
| **Risk** | Risk level badge |
| **Cost** | Estimated cost (or cost prevented) |
| **Policy** | Policy that triggered intervention |
| **Outcome** | Final outcome badge |

**Badges color coding:**
- 🔴 **Critical/Hard Block** - Red
- 🟠 **High/Approval Required** - Orange
- 🟡 **Medium/Rate Limited** - Yellow
- 🟢 **Low/Warning** - Green

## Intervention detail modal

Click any intervention to open the detail modal with 4 tabs:

### Overview tab

- **Intervention ID**
- **Timestamp**
- **Type & Outcome**
- **Risk Level**
- **Action Name**
- **Description**
- **Agent ID** (link to agent page)
- **Run ID** (link to run details)
- **Policy** (link to policy settings)

### Sentinel Reasoning tab

Shows why Sentinel intervened:

```
Reason: Action 'delete_production_database' is on the denied list

Agent Intent: Cleanup old test data

Blast Radius: Prevented deletion of 1M+ customer records
  - Database: production
  - Table: customers
  - Estimated impact: Data loss, service outage
  - Recovery cost: $50,000+
```

### Action Details tab

- **Original Inputs**: Parameters agent provided
- **Modified Inputs**: Changed parameters (if downgraded)
- **Estimated Cost**: What action would have cost
- **Actual Cost**: What was charged (0 if blocked)
- **Cost Prevented**: USD saved by blocking

### Context tab

- **Policy Details**: Full policy configuration
- **Related Runs**: Other runs by this agent
- **Similar Interventions**: Other blocks of same action
- **Adjust Policy**: Link to edit triggering policy

## Real-time updates

The page updates in real-time via WebSocket:

- **New interventions** - Appear at top of list with pulse animation
- **Stats refresh** - Counters update live
- **Notifications** - Browser notification for critical-risk blocks (if enabled)

**Connection indicator** (top right):
- 🟢 **REALTIME** - WebSocket connected
- 🟡 **POLLING** - Fallback polling mode

## Common workflows

### Review high-risk blocks

1. Click "Critical Risk" quick filter
2. Review each intervention
3. Determine if policy needs adjustment or agent logic needs fixing
4. Click "Adjust Policy" to modify rules

### Demonstrate ROI

1. Sort by "Cost Saved" (descending)
2. Export filtered results (CSV)
3. Sum cost_prevented_usd column
4. Present to stakeholders showing dollars saved

### Investigate agent misbehavior

1. Filter by agent_id
2. Review intervention types and frequencies
3. If many hard blocks: Agent attempting forbidden actions
4. If many budget exceeded: Agent needs cost optimization
5. Link to agent page for full statistics

### Tune policies

1. Group by policy (click policy name)
2. Review all interventions triggered by that policy
3. Identify false positives (legitimate actions blocked)
4. Adjust policy rules to reduce false positives
5. Monitor intervention rate decrease

## Exporting data

Click **Export** to download interventions:

1. Respects current filters
2. Choose format: CSV, JSON, JSONL
3. Includes all fields (type, outcome, risk, cost prevented, blast radius)
4. Use for reporting, compliance, analysis

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Review daily**: Check interventions every day to catch patterns early. High intervention rates may indicate policy misconfigurations.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Focus on critical/high risk**: Prioritize reviewing critical and high-risk blocks - these prevent the most damage.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Don't ignore warnings**: Even "warning" type interventions indicate risky behavior - review agent logic to eliminate warnings.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Document blast radius**: Use the blast radius field to quantify impact for stakeholder reports.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "No interventions showing"

- Check if any policies are enabled (Settings → Policies)
- Verify agents are using `PolicyEngine.configure()`
- Confirm SDK version includes intervention tracking
- Try removing all filters

### "Stats not updating"

- Check WebSocket connection (should show "REALTIME")
- Refresh page to reset connection
- Verify network allows WebSocket connections

### "Can't filter by agent"

- Type exact agent_id (case-sensitive)
- Use agent search (not action search)
- Check agent exists in Agents page
