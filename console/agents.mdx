## Overview

The **Agents Page** provides a centralized view of all agents in your organization. Agents are **automatically discovered** when they send their first run - no manual configuration required.

## Agent discovery

### How it works

1. Agent sends first run via SDK with `agent_id`
2. Platform automatically creates agent record
3. Metrics begin calculating in real-time
4. Agent appears in Agents list

**No setup required** - just instrument your agents with the SDK and they self-register.

## Agent list view

Main table shows all discovered agents:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Agent ID** | Unique identifier (click to view details) |
| **Display Name** | Human-readable name (editable) |
| **Description** | What the agent does (editable) |
| **Total Runs** | Lifetime run count |
| **Total Cost** | Lifetime USD spent |
| **Success Rate** | % of successful actions |
| **Intervention Rate** | % of actions blocked by policies |
| **Last Seen** | Timestamp of most recent run |
| **Status** | Active (green) or Inactive (gray) |

### Sorting

Sort by multiple fields:
- **Last Seen** - Most recently active
- **First Seen** - Oldest agents
- **Total Runs** - Most active agents
- **Total Cost** - Most expensive agents
- **Intervention Rate** - Most blocked agents
- **Success Rate** - Most/least reliable agents

Default: Last seen (descending).

### Filtering

- **Agent ID** - Partial match search
- **Status** - Active vs inactive
- **Organization** - (if multi-org enabled)

### Agent status

- **Active** (🟢) - Sent data in last 7 days
- **Inactive** (⚫) - No data in 7+ days

## Common workflows

### Identify high-cost agents

1. Sort by "Total Cost" (descending)
2. Review top 5 agents
3. For each:
   - Click to view details
   - Check "Top Actions" section
   - Identify expensive action types
   - Review "Cost Breakdown" pie chart
4. Optimize expensive actions:
   - Implement caching
   - Use cheaper models
   - Add rate limiting

### Monitor agent health

1. Sort by "Success Rate" (ascending)
2. Find agents with low success rates (< 90%)
3. For each:
   - Click to view details
   - Review recent runs
   - Filter errors in Activity Ledger
   - Identify common error patterns
4. Fix root causes

### Review intervention patterns

1. Sort by "Intervention Rate" (descending)
2. Find agents with high intervention rates (> 5%)
3. For each:
   - View interventions summary
   - Check what's being blocked
   - Determine if:
     - **Agent is misbehaving** - Fix agent logic
     - **Policies are too strict** - Adjust policies
4. Take corrective action

### Audit agent activity

1. Select agent
2. View "Recent Activity" section
3. Check for anomalies:
   - Sudden cost spikes
   - Drop in success rate
   - Increase in intervention rate
4. Investigate using filtered views (runs, actions, interventions)

### Set up new agent

1. Instrument agent code with SDK:
   ```python
   enable_remote_sync(
       platform_url="...",
       api_token="...",
       run_id="run-001"
   )
   ```
2. Run agent once
3. Return to Agents page - see agent auto-discovered
4. Click agent
5. Edit metadata:
   - Display Name: "Customer Support Bot"
   - Description: "Answers customer questions via email"
6. Save

## Best practices

<Tip>
**Use descriptive agent_id values**: Choose meaningful IDs like "customer-support-prod" instead of "agent1". Agent IDs cannot be changed.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Add display names immediately**: When a new agent appears, edit it to add a human-readable display name and description.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Monitor intervention rates**: Agents with intervention rates > 10% need attention - either agent logic or policies should be adjusted.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Low success rates indicate problems**: If success rate drops below 80%, investigate immediately - the agent may be broken.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Review top actions regularly**: Understanding which actions are most frequent helps optimize costs and identify bottlenecks.
</Tip>

## Metrics explained

### Success rate

```
Success Rate = (Successful Actions / Total Actions) × 100
```

- **90-100%**: Excellent - agent is reliable
- **70-89%**: Good - some errors expected
- **50-69%**: Poor - investigate errors
- **< 50%**: Critical - agent is broken

### Intervention rate

```
Intervention Rate = (Interventions / Total Actions) × 100
```

- **0-2%**: Normal - occasional policy blocks
- **3-5%**: Elevated - review policies
- **6-10%**: High - agent or policies need adjustment
- **> 10%**: Critical - major mismatch between agent behavior and policies

### Approval rate

```
Approval Rate = (Approved Requests / Total Requests) × 100
```

- **80-100%**: Good - agent requests appropriate actions
- **60-79%**: Moderate - some rejections expected
- **40-59%**: Poor - agent requesting inappropriate actions
- **< 40%**: Critical - review agent logic

## Troubleshooting

### "Agent not appearing"

- Verify agent has sent at least one run
- Check `agent_id` in SDK configuration
- Confirm `enable_remote_sync()` is called
- Check organization selector (may be in different org)

### "Stats not updating"

- Stats update every 5 minutes
- Refresh page to see latest data
- Check if agent has recent runs (Last Seen)
- Verify WebSocket connection (should show REALTIME)

### "Can't edit agent ID"

- Agent IDs are permanent (set on first run)
- Only display name and description are editable
- To change ID, create a new agent with different `agent_id`

### "Intervention rate seems high"

- Review "Interventions Summary" section
- Check which actions are being blocked
- Determine if policies are too strict or agent needs fixes
- Link to Interventions page for full details
