Agent Sentinel includes foundational hooks for EU AI Act–style logging and human oversight.

<Note>
  In v0.1 these features are **foundational stubs** and may be gated to Enterprise tiers in production deployments.
</Note>

## Human approval for actions

Mark an action as requiring approval:

```python
from agent_sentinel import guarded_action

@guarded_action(
    name="transfer_funds",
    cost_usd=0.10,
    requires_human_approval=True,
    approval_description="Transfer funds between accounts",
)
def transfer_funds(from_acct: str, to_acct: str, amount: float) -> None:
    ...
```

If no approval handler is configured, the action is blocked via `PolicyViolationError`.

## Register an approval handler

```python
from agent_sentinel import HumanApprovalHandler, ApprovalResponse, ApprovalStatus, ApprovalRequest

def approve(request: ApprovalRequest) -> ApprovalResponse:
    # Replace with your UI/workflow (Slack, web console, etc.)
    return ApprovalResponse(
        request_id=request.request_id,
        status=ApprovalStatus.APPROVED,
        approver_email="security@example.com",
        notes="Approved for test",
    )

HumanApprovalHandler.set_approval_handler(approve)
```

## Platform compliance endpoints

The platform provides endpoints like:

- `GET /api/v1/compliance/health`
- `POST /api/v1/compliance/export`
- `GET /api/v1/compliance/oversight`
