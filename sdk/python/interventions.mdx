## What are interventions?

Interventions are records of when Agent Sentinel's policy engine **actively prevented** or **modified** agent actions. They demonstrate the platform's core value proposition: showing what disasters were avoided, costs saved, and risks mitigated.

## Intervention types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `HARD_BLOCK` | Action completely denied by policy |
| `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` | Escalated for human approval |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | Blocked due to rate limiting |
| `BUDGET_EXCEEDED` | Blocked due to budget constraints |
| `DOWNGRADE` | Action parameters modified/reduced |
| `WARNING` | Allowed but flagged as risky |

## Intervention outcomes

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `BLOCKED` | Action was not executed |
| `ESCALATED` | Sent for human review |
| `APPROVED_AFTER_REVIEW` | Human approved after escalation |
| `REJECTED_AFTER_REVIEW` | Human rejected after escalation |
| `MODIFIED` | Action parameters were changed |
| `WARNED` | Action executed with warning |

## Automatic intervention tracking

Interventions are **automatically tracked** when:

- A policy denies an action
- A budget limit is exceeded
- Rate limiting triggers
- Human approval is required

```python
from agent_sentinel import guarded_action, PolicyEngine

# Configure strict budget
PolicyEngine.configure(
    session_budget=1.0,
    strict_mode=True
)

# This will trigger an intervention if budget is exceeded
@guarded_action(name="expensive_call", cost_usd=0.50)
def call_expensive_api():
    return "result"
```

## Intervention metadata

Each intervention records:

- **Action details**: name, description, inputs
- **Risk assessment**: risk level, blast radius (impact if allowed)
- **Cost metrics**: estimated cost, actual cost (if executed), cost prevented
- **Policy context**: which policy triggered the intervention
- **Agent context**: agent_id, run_id
- **Outcome**: what happened (blocked, approved, modified, etc.)
- **Rationale**: why Sentinel intervened
- **Agent intent**: what the agent was trying to do

## Viewing interventions

Interventions are stored locally in `.agent-sentinel/interventions.jsonl` and synced to the platform if remote sync is enabled.

View in the web console:
- Navigate to **Interventions** page
- See cost saved, high-risk blocks prevented
- Filter by type, outcome, risk level
- View detailed blast radius analysis

## Platform API

Interventions sync to the platform via the background sync service and can be queried via:

```bash
GET /api/v1/interventions
GET /api/v1/interventions/stats
GET /api/v1/interventions/{id}
```

## Example: Blast radius tracking

```python
from agent_sentinel import guarded_action, PolicyEngine

PolicyEngine.configure(
    denied_actions=["delete_production_database"]
)

@guarded_action(
    name="delete_production_database",
    cost_usd=0.0,
    tags=["dangerous", "destructive"]
)
def delete_db():
    # This will never execute - blocked by policy
    # Intervention will record:
    # - type: HARD_BLOCK
    # - risk_level: CRITICAL
    # - blast_radius: "Prevented deletion of production database"
    # - outcome: BLOCKED
    pass
```

## Cost prevention metrics

The platform calculates:
- **Total cost prevented**: Sum of estimated costs for blocked actions
- **High-risk blocks**: Count of critical/high-risk interventions
- **Top blocked actions**: Most frequently blocked action types
- **Triggering policies**: Which policies provide the most value

<Tip>
Interventions are your "receipts" - they show stakeholders exactly what disasters Agent Sentinel prevented.
