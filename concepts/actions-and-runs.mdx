## Actions

An **action** is a single instrumented unit of work in your agent (a tool call, API request, DB query, etc.).

In the Python SDK, actions are created by decorating functions with `@guarded_action(...)`.

Each action records:

- **Name**: `name` argument (or the function name)
- **Cost**: `cost_usd` (you supply the estimate for that call)
- **Duration**: measured automatically
- **Outcome**: `"success"`, `"error"`, or `"replayed"`
- **Inputs/outputs**: captured from the call
- **Tags**: optional list of strings

## Runs

A **run** represents one execution of your agent (one “session” you want to analyze end-to-end).

On the platform, a run:

- Owns many actions
- Aggregates `total_cost`
- Has a `status` such as `"running"` / `"completed"`

## Run IDs in v0.1

In v0.1:

- The **local ledger entries do not include `run_id`** in each JSON line.
- When using remote sync, the SDK sends a **separate `run_id`** alongside a batch of entries (see <a href="/sdk/python/remote-sync">Remote sync</a>).

This means:

- Local replay currently replays **sequentially** from a ledger file; filtering by `run_id` is limited (see <a href="/sdk/python/replay">Replay</a>).
- Platform-side run grouping is defined by the `run_id` used by the sync client.

<Tip>
  If you want stable run grouping, pass an explicit `run_id` into `enable_remote_sync(...)` and keep it fixed for the lifetime of that agent run.
