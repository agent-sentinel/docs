Agent Sentinel policies give you a **kill switch** for unsafe actions and a **cost control plane** for your agent.

In v0.1, policies are enforced by the SDK **before** the decorated function executes.

## What policies can do

- **Budgets**
  - Session budget: cap total spend across the process lifetime
  - Run budget: cap total spend per run
  - Action budgets: cap spend for a given action name across calls
- **Allow/Deny lists**
  - Deny specific action names
  - Allowlist mode: only permit a specific set of action names
- **Rate limits**
  - Per-action windows: `max_count` per `window_seconds`

If a policy is violated, the SDK raises:

- `BudgetExceededError`
- `PolicyViolationError`

## Local configuration

You can configure policies in code or via `callguard.yaml`.

See:

- <a href="/sdk/python/policies">SDK policies & budgets</a>

## Remote policy sync (platform)

If you enable remote policy sync, the SDK downloads policies from:

```text
GET /api/v1/policies/sync?agent_id=...&run_id=...
```

The platform returns policies by scope:

- **global** (`scope="global"`)
- **agent** (`scope="agent"`, `target_id=<agent_id>`)
- **run** (`scope="run"`, `target_id=<run_id>`)

The SDK merges them in order (global → agent → run) and applies the **most restrictive** settings for budgets and limits.
