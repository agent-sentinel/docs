description: "Replay analysis endpoints for determinism and divergence detection."
---

The platform includes endpoints that **simulate** replay and analyze runs for non-determinism.

<Note>
  In v0.1 the platform replay endpoint does not execute your code. For actual replay execution, use the SDK (<a href="/sdk/python/replay">Replay</a>).
</Note>

## Replay a run (simulation)

```text
POST /api/v1/replay/{run_id}
```

This inspects recorded inputs and flags common sources of non-determinism (timestamps, random values, UUIDs).

## Determinism analysis

```text
GET /api/v1/replay/analysis/{run_id}
```

Returns a “determinism score” and recommendations.
